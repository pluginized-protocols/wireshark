= Wireshark {wireshark-version} Release Notes
// Asciidoctor Syntax Quick Reference:
// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/

This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 3.6.

== What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

== What’s New

Many improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.

// === Bug Fixes

// The following bugs have been fixed:

//* wsbuglink:5000[]
//* wsbuglink:6000[Wireshark bug]
//* cveidlink:2014-2486[]
//* Wireshark keeps banging out random chords on your piano and yelling “LIPS LIKE SUGUAR, SUGAR KISSES” because it was funny that one time at a party.

=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 3.4.0:

* The Windows installers now ship with Npcap 1.20.
They previously shipped with Npcap 1.10.

* TCP conversations now support a completeness criteria, which facilitates the identification of TCP streams having any
  of opening or closing handshakes, a payload, in any combination. It is accessed with the new tcp.completeness filter.

* Protobuf fields that are not serialized on the wire (missing in capture files) can now be displayed with default values
  by setting the new 'add_default_value' preference. The default values might be explicitly declared in 'proto2' files,
  or false for bools, first value for enums, zero for numeric types.

* Wireshark now supports reading Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). A new extcap named ETW reader is created that now can open an etl file, convert all
  events in the file to DLT_ETW packets and write to a specified FIFO destination. Also, a new packet_etw dissector is
  created to dissect DLT_ETW packets so Wireshark can display the DLT_ETW packet header, its message and packet_etw dissector
  calls packet_mbim sub_dissector if its provider matches the MBIM provider GUID.

* "Follow DCCP stream" feature to filter for and extract the contents of DCCP streams.

* Wireshark now supports dissecting the rtp packet with OPUS payload.

* Importing captures from text files is now also possible based on regular expressions. By specifying a regex capturing a single
  packet including capturing groups for relevant fields a textfile can be converted to a libcap capture file. Supported data
  encodings are plain-hexadecimal, -octal, -binary and base64.
  Also the timestamp format now allows the second-fractions to be placed anywhere in the timestamp and it will be stored with
  nanosecond instead of microsecond precision.
